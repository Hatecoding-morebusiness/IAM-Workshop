Certainly! Here's a comprehensive guide detailing all the commands and steps to set up **Web Authentication with Identity and Access Management (IAM)** using Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C). This guide will walk you through deploying a simple HTML-based web application on an Azure Virtual Machine (VM), integrating Azure AD B2C for user authentication, and implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to enhance security.

**Document: Implementing Web Authentication with Azure AD B2C**

**Overview:**

This document provides a step-by-step guide to implementing user authentication in a web application using Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C). By integrating Azure AD B2C, you can ensure that only authenticated users can access specific parts of your web application, enhancing security and user management.

**Prerequisites:**

- Basic understanding of web development and HTTP protocols.
- An active Azure subscription with sufficient permissions to create resources.
- A domain name (optional) if you plan to configure custom domains.

**Setup Instructions:**

**1. Set Up the Virtual Machine (VM):**

   - **Create an Azure Virtual Machine:**
     - Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
     - Navigate to the "Virtual machines" section and click "Create" > "Azure virtual machine."
     - Configure the basic settings:
       - **Subscription:** Choose your subscription.
       - **Resource group:** Create a new resource group or select an existing one.
       - **Virtual machine name:** Enter a name for your VM.
       - **Region:** Select a region close to you.
       - **Image:** Choose an operating system (e.g., Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS).
       - **Size:** Select an appropriate size (e.g., Standard B1s).
     - Configure the administrator account:
       - **Authentication type:** Password or SSH public key.
       - **Username:** Enter a username.
       - **Password/SSH public key:** Enter a password or provide your SSH public key.
     - Configure inbound port rules:
       - **Public inbound ports:** Allow selected ports.
       - **Inbound ports to allow:** Select SSH (22) and HTTP (80).
     - Review and create the VM.

   - **Connect to the VM:**
     - If you chose SSH for authentication, use an SSH client to connect:
       ```bash
       ssh username@your_vm_public_ip
       ```
     - If you chose password authentication, use an SSH client or Azure's Cloud Shell to connect.

**2. Install and Configure the Web Server:**

   - **Update the System Packages:**
     ```bash
     sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
     ```
   - **Install Nginx Web Server:**
     ```bash
     sudo apt install nginx -y
     ```
   - **Start and Enable Nginx:**
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl start nginx
     sudo systemctl enable nginx
     ```
   - **Verify Nginx Installation:**
     - Access the public IP of your VM in a web browser to see the Nginx welcome page.

**3. Deploy the HTML-Based Web Application:**

   - **Create a Simple HTML Page:**
     - Navigate to the Nginx default root directory:
       ```bash
       cd /var/www/html/
       ```
     - Create an `index.html` file:
       ```html
       <!DOCTYPE html>
       <html lang="en">
       <head>
           <meta charset="UTF-8">
           <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
           <title>IAM Workshop</title>
       </head>
       <body>
           <h1>Welcome to the IAM Workshop Web Application</h1>
           <p>Please <a href="login.html">log in</a> to continue.</p>
       </body>
       </html>
       ```
   - **Set Permissions:**
     ```bash
     sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/html/index.html
     ```

**4. Integrate Azure Active Directory B2C for User Authentication:**

   - **Create an Azure AD B2C Tenant:**
     - In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), search for "Azure AD B2C" and select it.
     - Click "Create a new Azure AD B2C Tenant."
     - Provide an organization name, initial domain name, and country/region.
     - Click "Create."

   - **Register the Web Application:**
     - In the Azure AD B2C tenant, navigate to "App registrations" and click "New registration."
     - Provide a name for the application (e.g., "IAM Workshop App").
     - Under "Redirect URI," select "Web" and enter the URL where users will be redirected after signing in (e.g., `http://your_vm_public_ip/auth-callback`).
     - Click "Register."

   - **Create User Flows:**
     - Navigate to "User flows" and click "New user flow."
     - Select the "Sign up and sign in" flow.
     - Provide a name for the user flow (e.g., "B2C_1_susi").
     - Under "Identity providers," select "Email signup."
     - Under "User attributes and claims," select the attributes you want to collect (e.g., Display Name, Email Addresses).
     - Click "Create."
